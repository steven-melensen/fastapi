# An empty __init__.py file in a Python package serves the following purposes:

# 1. Package Recognition:
#    The presence of an __init__.py file in a directory tells Python that the directory 
#    should be treated as a package, enabling you to import modules from it.

# 2. Namespace Initialization:
#    In older versions of Python (before Python 3.3), an __init__.py file was required 
#    for Python to recognize the directory as a package. Without it, the directory wouldn’t 
#    be considered part of the module’s namespace, and you couldn't import anything from it.
#    Although Python 3.3 and later support namespace packages without an __init__.py file, 
#    the file is still used for regular packages.

# 3. Optional Initialization Code:
#    While an __init__.py file can be empty, it can also contain initialization code 
#    that runs when the package is imported. This can include importing submodules, 
#    setting up package-level variables, or executing any setup code necessary for the package.
